# Duckpin2

A project to light the Lucite numbers, and determine ball location and velocity.

As a hobbyist with a life-long interest in what makes things work, I look for projects that are more than demonstrations of “cool” technology.  For years, I wanted an Arduino or Raspberry Pi (RPI) but avoided the “technical investment” because I wanted to do more than turn on LEDs.  Similarly, with IOT I wanted to stream and store more than local weather data.    

The pinsetters at Congressional Country Club are ancient.  They are controlled by mechanical relays in a Gold-Ruberg artform.  When I bring guests to the Club, the pinsetters are a must stop and I can spend at least 15 minutes watching them perform.  Each lane headboard shown below has a display of pin numbers, but they are not functional.  Could I use a computer to light the numbers?  Could I track the ball’s location, angle, and speed and measure the result?  Did I find a use for a RPI and IOT in one project?
